## Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?

  - If a customer wants to tip an employee with a card, it currently requires the owner of the business to custody that tip, and pay it out to the worker at the end of the day. A tip is conventionally thought of as a private payment between service purchaser and provider. Customers and workers alike do not appreciate the lack of privacy, and often opt to tip cash because of its privacy features. Tipsease provides service workers’ tip payments with this additional privacy and convenience. 

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

  - When using Tipsease, an employer no longer custodies a service workers’ charged tips. The money goes directly to the tipped employee.

- What is the mission statement?

  - Provide autonomy
